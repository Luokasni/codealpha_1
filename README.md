**Machine Learning Model Comparison on the Iris Dataset**  

This project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning models on the Iris dataset using Python and Scikit-Learn. It includes:  
- Data loading, preprocessing, and visualization  
- Training and testing with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, and Naive Bayes  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy scores and cross-validation  
- Overfitting analysis by comparing training and testing accuracy  
- Visualization of model performance using Seaborn  

This repository serves as a reference for beginners exploring classification models and performance analysis in machine learning. ðŸš€
